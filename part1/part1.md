part 1a

1. 20

2. 20

3. 20

4. This one returns an error because result is not defined (due to let being a block scope type)

5/6. Neither lines return anything (error because we're attempting to modify a constant variable). 
However, if you commented out line 7, you should get a result of zero.

part 1b

1. It prints out 3 after checking the condition and breaking from the for loop.

2. The last price was 300/2 or 150

3. Since there are no decimals, it does nothing and we get 150.

4. It returns 50, 100, 150 -> returns the array but with all the stuff in it divided by two and rounded.

5. It prints out 3 because it does the same thing as one but since we don't attempt to anything with the let types, nothing changes

6.
